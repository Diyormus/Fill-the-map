# -----Module Description - Drawing Canvas Configuration--------------#
#
#  This module contains functions needed for Assignment 1 in
#  QUT's teaching unit IFB104 "Building IT Systems".  You should put
#  a copy of this file in the same folder as your solution to the
#  assignment.  The necessary elements will then be imported
#  into your program automatically.
#
#  NB: Do NOT submit this file with your solution.  Changes made to
#  this module will have no effect when your assignment is graded
#  because the markers will use their own copy of the file.  If your
#  solution relies on changes made to this file it will fail to work
#  when assessed.

# -----Preamble-------------------------------------------------------#
#
# This section defines constants and imports necessary functions
# used for creating the drawing canvas.
#

# Setting these constants will force the drawing canvas to open
# in a specific place on the screen
canvas_corner_top = None
canvas_corner_left = None

# Import standard Python functions needed to support this module.
from turtle import *
from sys import platform
from math import sqrt

# Define the length of the sides of the cells. All other dimensions
# for the drawing canvas are calculated relative to this value.
cell_width = 110  # pixels
assert cell_width >= 80, 'Cells must be at least 80x80 pixels'
cell_height = round((sqrt(3) * cell_width) / 2)  # trigonometry!

# Define the width and height of the grid.
grid_width = 9  # cell widths (i.e., half the no. of columns)
grid_height = 6  # rows
assert grid_width % 2 != 0, 'Grid width must be odd'
assert grid_height % 2 == 0, 'Grid height must be even'

# Define a horizontal offset for the grid, allowing it
# to be shifted left or right
grid_offset = -cell_width  # pixels

# Define values that determine the size of the
# drawing canvas, proportional to the given cell size.
x_margin = cell_width * 1.7  # pixels, left/right margin
y_margin = cell_width / 3  # pixels, top/bottom margin
canvas_height = grid_height * cell_width + y_margin * 2
canvas_width = grid_width * cell_width + x_margin * 2

# -----Functions for Maintaining the Drawing Canvas-------------------#
#
# The functions in this section are called by the assignment template
# to manage the drawing canvas used by your program.  Your code must
# not call these functions and your code must not create its own
# drawing canvas.
#

# Set up the canvas and draw the background for the overall image
